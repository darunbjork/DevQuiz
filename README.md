# DevQuiz: Our First Big React Project! 🚀

Hey there! 👋 We're super excited to share DevQuiz, our project for learning and testing our knowledge on various topics, especially with a cool AI twist! We poured a lot of effort (and maybe a few late nights 😅) into making this happen.

## What is DevQuiz?

DevQuiz is a web application where users can:

*   **Study with AI:** Input your study notes, and our awesome AI (powered by Gemini) will generate a multiple-choice quiz for you! How cool is that? ✨
*   **Take Quizzes:** Test your knowledge on AI-generated quizzes.
*   **Track Progress:** See your quiz history, performance analytics, and manage your created quizzes all in one place.
*   **Dark Mode Toggle:** Because who doesn't love dark mode? 😎 We worked hard to make sure it looks good everywhere!

## Our Journey & What We Learned 🛠️

Building DevQuiz was an amazing learning experience! Here are some of the things we tackled and some of the "aha!" moments we had:

*   **React & TypeScript:** This project really pushed us to get comfortable with React hooks, components, and the power of TypeScript for type-safety. Sometimes TypeScript felt like a strict teacher, but it definitely saved us from some silly bugs!
*   **Routing (React Router DOM):** Setting up navigation and protected routes was a fun challenge. We learned how to make sure only logged-in users could access certain parts of the app.
*   **State Management:** Keeping track of user data, quiz questions, and scores across different components was tricky. We got a lot of practice with `useState` and `useContext`.
*   **AI Integration (Gemini API):** Connecting to the Gemini API was probably the most exciting part! We learned how to send prompts and parse the AI's responses to create dynamic content. Getting the prompt *just right* was an art form!
*   **Styling with CSS Variables & Dark Mode:** Making the app look good in both light and dark modes, and ensuring everything was readable, taught us a lot about CSS variables and responsive design. We had a few head-scratchers trying to get colors just right in dark mode, but we got there! 💪
*   **Debugging (Oh, the Debugging!):** We spent a good amount of time with `console.log` and the browser's developer tools. Learning to understand error messages and trace problems was a huge skill we sharpened.
*   **Git & GitHub:** Collaborating (even just with ourselves!) using Git commands like `add`, `commit`, `branch`, and `checkout` became second nature. We even learned about `git stash` the hard way! (Don't ask! 🙈)

## Future Ideas (If we had more time!) 💡

*   **More Quiz Customization:** Allow users to specify quiz difficulty, question types (true/false, fill-in-the-blank), or number of questions.
*   **Quiz Sharing:** Let users share their AI-generated quizzes with friends.
*   **Flashcards:** Integrate a flashcard feature for active recall.
*   **User Avatars/Personalization:** Make the profile page even more customizable.
